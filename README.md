## Topic : Bending of Thick Circular Plate
It is coded in jupyter notebook using symbolic python which aims at finding deflection in thick circular plate in case of bending using Mindlin's theory.
It includes Derivation of governing differential equation for Bending of Plate using Mindlin's Theory & then conversion to Polar form & then to Axisymmetric Polar Form.
Then solution for deflection for 2 different boundary conditions for circular plates in case of uniform loading.
